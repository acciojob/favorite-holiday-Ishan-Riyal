	<h1>Iceland</h1>
	<br/>
	<p>As someone who hasn’t been to Iceland yet but dreams of going, it feels like a place full of wild, untouched beauty and unique experiences. I imagine vast landscapes with glaciers, volcanoes, and waterfalls everywhere you turn, and the chance to see the Northern Lights glowing in the dark sky. I’ve heard about the famous Golden Circle route and the soothing Blue Lagoon, which sound like perfect spots to explore and relax. It seems like a safe and friendly country, great for adventurous travelers who love nature and want to experience something completely different from everyday life. Visiting Iceland feels like it would be an unforgettable adventure.</p>
